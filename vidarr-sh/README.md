**These plugins are not intended for production use!!!** This allows workflows
to be simple shell scripts. This is not intended for normal use, but it can be
helpful when developing provisions or as an example of a very simple workflow
engine.

The workflow engine can be configured as:

   { "type": "sh" }

No configuration options are available. No provisioners are available with this
plugin.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [0.16.0] - 2023-08-22

### Changed

* error message for invalid consumable resource priority value, to clarify valid priority values
* Check whether each consumable resource is required as input from the submitter


## [0.15.1] - 2023-08-17

### Fixed

* issue with deploying updated verison of flyway-core by reverting it to known good version


## [0.15.0] - 2023-08-17

### Added

* priority as a consumable resource on all Vidarr targets


## [0.14.0] - 2023-08-04

### Added

* Parsing for full Vidarr workflow run IDs in the vidarr-workflow-run-id unload filter

### Fixed

* Copy-out & unload correctly format empty accessoryFiles as `{}` rather than
  null, allowing load to accept the output
  
* Return correct status code for workflow creation/update


## [0.13.0] - 2023-06-12

### Added

* Added optional consumable resource "priority" which can be used to specify the order in which workflow runs are allocated resources

### Changed

* Provenance requests for LATEST version now return the version with the most recent `requested` date, not the most recent `created` date.


## [0.12.0] - 2023-03-07

### Fixed

* Patch security vulnerability and upgrade other dependencies


## [0.11.1] - 2023-02-06

### Fixed

* Fix OpenAPI syntax error


## [0.11.0] - 2023-01-26

### Added

* Provide a loadable file with sample provenance data

### Changed

* Removed `/waiting` endpoint, as it isn't useful to our users, and errors in dev and production
* Remove Niassa plugin

### Upgrade Notes

* Update code to use Java 17 features


## [0.10.0] - 2022-11-03

### Added

* Add workflow ID to GET `/api/workflow/{name}/{version}` API endpoint. This can be used for deleting workflow runs by `vidarr-workflow-id`.
* Adds recovery-failures API endpoint which returns workflow run ids of any runs which failed to recover from the database on restart.

### Changed

* Wraps a significant chunk of DatabaseBackedProcessor.recover() in try-catch Exception block. This changes the error handling of SQLException on startup for now. Intend to fix this in a later release.

### Fixed

* Fixes Cromwell provision-out retry behaviour to account for situation where cromwell does not return an ID.


## [0.9.1] - 2022-09-14

### Fixed

* Fix bug where Vidarr workflow runs were not recorded as FAILED if the Cromwell workflow run failed and debugging workflows was turned on


## [0.9.0] - 2022-09-08

### Added

* Adds debug calls to cromwell workflow engine and output provisioner config
* * Adds a new `retry` type that allows a workflows that fail to be retried with different arguments

### Fixed

* ### Fixed
* Fixes Provision In phase not logging recovery information in a useable format.
* Fixes uncaught exceptions interrupting db-backed recovery.


## [0.8.1] - 2022-08-03

### Fixed

* Bugfix for null cromwell ids getting stuck in check() loop
* Readability of AutoInhibit alert messages
* Exclude calls from metadata unless we know the workflow run is failed for performance reasons
* Update integration tests:
  * Move testdata to new resource path to prevent classpath collision
  * Update database integration tests to use same postgresql version as other ITs and Vidarr deploys
* Use explicit versions for Jackson dependencies instead of the version range that dependabot suggested


## [0.8.0] - 2022-06-21

### Added

* Add index on Niassa's workflowRunSWID to `workflow_run` table
* Add an index on `analysis(analysis_type)` and `analysis(hash_id)` to improve the performance of matching submitted requests to existing workflow runs

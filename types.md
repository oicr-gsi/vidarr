# Understanding the Víðarr Type System
Víðarr has three separate type systems:

- basic types
- input types
- output types

Input types are used for arguments to workflows. Output types are used for
metadata from workflows. Basic types are used for engine parameters and as
part of input and output types when they are required by plugins.

The reasoning is something like this: input values can be anything a workflow
can take in. That's a primitive types (numbers, strings, Booleans), complex
types (lists, structures, pairs), and files (and directories). Files need to go
through a provisioning process and the plugin requires additional information
to provision in a file. The plugin can accept primitive types and complex
types, but _not_ additional files. So, basic types are primitives and
collections of primitives. Input types are primitives, files/directories, and
collections of those.

The outputs are...weird. The workflow is outputting some kind of data and the
submitter of the workflow needs to provide the _metadata_ to be associated with
that data. So the types of the output have very different constraints from the
input types and the output type information is interpreted differently in the
workflow's output vs the submission request. Like input types, the plugins
handling output types require information, so basic types are embedded in the
output type information.

## Basic Types
Basic types can be basic primitive types, in the following table, or complex
types described in detail after the table. All types have JSON encoding.

| JSON Type Encoding | Description                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `"boolean"`        | Boolean types, in standard JSON encoding              |
| `"date"`           | A string containing an ISO-8601 time including a zone |
| `"floating"`       | A floating point value; precision is not specified    |
| `"integer"`        | An integer value; precision is not specified          |
| `"json"`           | Arbitrary JSON data that is not type checked          |
| `"string"`         | A string                                              |

- `{"is": "dictionary", "key":` _key-type_`, "value": ` _value-type_ `}`
A dictionary/map type. This value has two possible encodings. If the _key-type_
is a string, it _may_ be encoded as a JSON object. It can also be encoded as a
list of lists, where the inner lists are all two elements: the key and value.

- `{"is": "list", "inner":` _type_ `}`
A list/array of items, encoded as a JSON array.

- `{"is": "object", "fields": {` _field-name1_ `:` _field-type1_`,` ... `} }`
A structure encoded as a JSON object. All fields must be present. The field
names must follow JSON property name rules.

- `{"is": "optional", "inner":` _type_ `}`
A value which may be absent. If absent, it is encoded as `null`. Nesting this
type has no meaningful effect; that is optional of optional of string is
functionally identical to optional of string.

- `{"is": "pair", "left":` _left-type_`, "right":` _right-type_ `}`
A pair of values. This exists mostly as a special case of WDL. It is encoded as
a JSON object with two properties `"left"` and `"right"`.

- `{"is": "tagged-union", "options": { `_name1_ `:` _type1_`,` ... `} }`
Create a tagged union type (or algebraic data type). The value provides one
particular value based on the options available. These are encoded as `{"type":
`_name_`, "contents": `_value_`}` where _name_ is the name of the selected
option and _value_ is a value of the matching type.

For details, see Shesmu's algebraic data types. Shesmu has the restriction that
the types must be tuples or objects, but Víðarr does not enforce this
restriction.

- `{"is": "tuple", "elements": [` _type1_`,` _type2_`,` ... `] }`
A heterogenous tuple of values. A tuple is effectively an object but with
numerical indices instead of field names. It is encoded as a JSON array.

## Input Types
All of the conventions for basic types applies to input types. Additionally,
`"file"` and `"directory"` types are supported.

In both cases, the exact type will depend on the plugins on the server. The
submitter can provide either:

- a file known to Víðarr by its ID: `{"type": "INTERNAL", "contents": ["`_id_`"]}`
- an external file and the external identifiers for this file: `{"type": "EXTERNAL", "contents": {"externalIds": `_externals_`, "configuration": `_config_`} }`

_id_ is a single Víðarr ID in the form `vidarr:`_instance_`/`_hash_.
_externals_ is a list of external IDs, encoded as an array of `{"id":
"`_identifier_`", "provider": "`_provider_`"}` objects, where _identifier_ and
_provider_ are arbitrary strings that match up to an external data source, such
as LIMS. _configuration_ is the value expected by the plugin. The workflow does
not know the correct type for _configuration_; the target has this information.

## Output Types
The output types are very different from the input and basic types. There are
a few base output types, in the table below. These base types affect what the
workflow outputs to Víðarr, but the submitter always provides metadata in this
form:

- `{"type": "ALL", "contents": [`_configuration_`]}`
This associates the output with all of the external IDs provided with the workflow run.
- `{"type": "REMAINING", "contents": [`_configuration_`]}`
This associates the output with the external IDs provided with the workflow run
not included in a `MANUAL` reference.
- `{"type": "MANUAL", "contents": [`_configuration_`, `_externals_`]}`
This associates the output with a specific set of the external IDs in
_externals_, which is a list of `{"id": "`_identifier_`", "provider":
"`_provider_`"}` objects.

In each case, the type of _configuration_ depends on the output type and the
target used. The workflow's output is described in the table.

| Output Type                    | WDL Type                                   |  Workflow Output                                                              |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"file"`                       | `File`                                     | A single file                                                                 |
| `"optional-file"`              | `File?`                                    | An optional single file                                                       |
| `"files"`                      | `Array[File]+`                             | A list of files                                                               |
| `"optional-files"`             | `Array[File]?`                             | An optional list of files                                                     |
| `"file-with-labels"`           | `Pair[File, Map[String, String]]`          | A pair of a file and a dictionary of strings                                  |
| `"optional-file-with-labels"`  | `Pair[File, Map[String, String]]?`         | An optional pair of a file and a dictionary of strings                        |
| `"files-with-labels"`          | `Pair[Array[File]+, Map[String, String]]`  | A pair of a list of files and a dictionary of strings                         |
| `"optional-files-with-labels"` | `Pair[Array[File]+, Map[String, String]]?` | An optional pair of a list of files and a dictionary of strings               |
| `"logs"`                       | N/A                                        | A single file containing text logs                                            |
| `"optional-logs"`              | N/A                                        | An optional single file containing text logs                                  |
| `"quality-control"`            | `Boolean`                                  | A Boolean value which indicates pass/fail                                     |
| `"optional-quality-control"`   | `Boolean?`                                 | An optional Boolean value which indicates pass/fail                           |
| `"warehouse-records"`          | N/A                                        | A single file containing structured data to be stored in a database           |
| `"optional-warehouse-records"` | N/A                                        | An optional single file containing structured data to be stored in a database |

For the data warehouse, the plugin and workflow must be mutually aware of the
data format.

In the types with labels, the workflow can add arbitrary information that gets
attached to the provisioned out file. This is useful to provide information
about the contents of a file that can be used by downstream processing. For
instance, workflow producing a FASTQ or BAM file could include a sequence
count, so a Shesmu olive consuming this file could pick an appropriate shard
count for a subsequent workflow.

Each output type has an optional variant. If used, the workflow can decline to
provide the output and it will not be provisioned. However, all external keys
must be assigned somewhere, so _every_ external key _must_ be assigned to at
least one non-optional output. This means there must be at least one
non-optional output for a workflow. Also, using `REMAINING` on mandatory values
has ambiguous meaning when `MANUAL` is used on optional outputs. If the
optional was or was not present, then the external keys included in `REMAINING`
would change dynamically. This is not permitted, so mixing these two is not
possible.

In some workflows that expand or multiplex content (_e.g_, co-cleaning,
BCL2FASTQ), the output metadata needs to be dynamically assigned to the output
files. In that case, the list type is available:

- `{"is": "list", "keys": {`_key-name1_`:` _key-type1_`,` ... `}, "outputs": {` _output-name1_`:` _output-type1_`, ` ... `}}`

The allows the submitter to supply a list of structures with metadata and the
workflow to supply a list of structures with output and Víðarr will marry them
based on the keys.

The _key-typeN_ must be either `"INTEGER"` or `"STRING"` and the _output-typeN_
are the output types above. There must be no overlap between _key-nameN_ and
_output-name_.

This is easier with a concrete example. Suppose this is a BCL2FASTQ workflow
producing multiple FASTQs based on the sample name. The type definition would
be as follows:

    {
      "is": "list",
      "keys": {
        "sample_name": "STRING"
      },
      "outputs": {
        "fastqs": "files"
      }
    }

Now, the submitter would produce a structure like this:

    [
      {
        "fastqs": {
          "contents": [
            ...,
            [
              {
                "id": "RUN0001_SAM0001",
                "provider": "lims"
              }
            ]
          ],
          "type": "MANUAL"
        },
        "sample_name": "SAM0001"
      },
      {
        "fastqs": {
          "contents": [
            ...,
            [
              {
                "id": "RUN0001_SAM0002",
                "provider": "lims"
              }
            ]
          ],
          "type": "MANUAL"
        },
        "sample_name": "SAM0002"
      }
    ]

The plugin-specific information has been elided for brevity.

The workflow would produce a structure like this:

    [
      {
        "fastqs": [
          "/srv/output/abcdefg/SAM0001_R1.fastq.gz",
          "/srv/output/abcdefg/SAM0001_R2.fastq.gz"
        ],
        "sample_name": "SAM0001"
      },
      {
        "fastqs": [
          "/srv/output/abcdefg/SAM0002_R1.fastq.gz",
          "/srv/output/abcdefg/SAM0002_R2.fastq.gz"
        ],
        "sample_name": "SAM0002"
      }
    ]

The workflow can recycle input associations (_i.e._, if there are two output
structures with `"sample_name": "SAM0001"`, that is fine). The workflow must
use all of the associations provided (_i.e._, if the submitter provided
`SAM0001` and `SAM0002` and the workflow only produces output for `SAM0001`,
this is an error).

If multiple keys are used, they are treated like a composite key.

## Empty Tuples and Objects
Tuples are designed in a way to mirror Shesmu. Shesmu has tuples (heterogenous
ordered collections of types) and object/named tuples (heterogenous named
collections of types). Tuples get written to JSON as array and named tuples get
written to JSON as objects. Objects in Shesmu don't support any kind of
inheritance. So, if you have a function that takes `{ foo = integer, bar =
string}`, you can't supply `{foo = 3, bar = "hi", quux = 7.5}`; that's a type
error.


Single-element tuples and single-field named tuples are...sort of pointless,
but not wrong. Empty tuples and empty named tuples aren't allowed. Trying to
write `{}` is a syntax error in Shesmu (and even if it was allowed, it would be
ambiguously an empty tuple or an empty named tuple). Single-element tuples
aren't entirely pointless because `+` can concatenate tuples, so `{3, "hi"} +
{7.5}` is legal and equivalent to `{3, "hi", 7.5}`. At this point, you
might think that we should say that empty tuples are illegal, but there's a
special case.

Shesmu also got algebraic types. An algebraic type allows a choice of different
options, like an `enum` in Java,  but those options may carry data. Inside
Shesmu, there are 3 kinds:

- the "empty" algebraic value (`FOO`), which works like a Java `enum`; there's no data attached
- the "tuple" algebraic value (`BAR { "hi" }`) where the data that's attached that looks like a tuple
- the "object" algebraic value (`QUUX { value = "hi" }`) where the data that's attached looks like an object

In the JSON representation, they look like `{"type": "QUUX", "contents":
{"value": "hi"}}` and `{"type":"BAR", "contents":["hi"]}` for the object and
tuple forms, respectively.

For the empty ones, Shesmu is not picky. You can represent an empty tuple as
`{"type":"FOO", "contents": []}`, `{"type":"FOO", "contents": {}}`, or
`{"type":"FOO", "contents": null}`. As long as the contents are "empty", it's
not picky what kind of empty you want to represent.

Now, let's get into the representation details...

Shesmu has a descriptor that represents all possible types. For `BAR { string }
| QUUX { value = string }`, it would represent that as
`u2BAR$t1sQUUX$o1value$s`, which reads as `u2` this in algebraic (union) type
that has two values in it. One allowed label is `BAR` which has the arguments
`t1s`, a tuple t of 1 element that is a `s`tring. The second allowed label is
`QUUX`, which has an `o`bject type with 1 field named value which has the type
`s`tring.

How should FOO get represented? The easiest was `FOO$t0`? Shesmu basically
treats every "empty" algebraic value as one with an empty tuple. The underlying
Java implementation is exactly that since an algebraic value is represented as
a label and `Object[]` of its contents. A lot of Shesmu code is simplified
because of this. It becomes a special case to handle in the parser and then
everything else is just a lot of `i < length` that just works.

On to Vidarr: This quaint setup Shesmu has is complicated and Vidarr doesn't
really care. Vidarr sees an algebraic type as a label + a type. If you want
Shesmu to handle that, that other type better be a tuple or an object, but once
again, Vidarr doesn't really care. Similarly, putting an empty tuple anywhere
is going to make Shesmu unhappy, but Vidarr doesn't care. In an effort to keep
Vidarr simple, allowing types that are extremely weird or pointless or
unShesmotic are not a problem.

This caring also extends to the other side. WDL doesn't let you create an empty
object. WDL doesn't have tuple types. WDL doesn't have algebraic types. So,
as along as `wdl2vidarr` produces types that make Shesmu happy, Vidarr is happy
to launder them and it really doesn't care if you can also express types that
Shesmu and WDL can't type. If you make types in your workflow that aren't
useful, Vidarr shouldn't care. As long as they have a valid JSON
representation, Vidarr is happy.
